# Web Scraping Websites
A project that compiles codes for multiple web scraping websites

## About the Project

This project is in collaboration with the Growth Hack department, where we help automate web scraping processes for websites that can provide potential leads to both Meniaga and Adnexio. After discussions, we have decided to automate 7 websites. Those websites are the basis for the 7 python files that existed in this project.
